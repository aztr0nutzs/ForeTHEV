Let's walk through the app step-by-step. 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️

How to Create Your Account 🧑‍💻



The first time you open the app, it will ask you to "Sign Up" or "Log In."

    Tap the "Sign Up" button. 👋

    The app will ask for your basic information, such as:

        Your Name 📛

        Your Email Address ✉️

        A new Password 🔑

    Fill in these fields. ✍️

        Tool Tip: Your password is like a secret key. Choose something you can remember but that others wouldn't guess. It's a good idea to write it down in a safe place. 🤫

    Once you're done, tap the "Create Account" or "Register" button. ✅

    That's it! You'll now be logged in. 🎉 In the future, you'll just use the "Log In" button with your email and the password you just created. ➡️

How to See Events & Activities 🎉

When you open the app, you will most likely land on the main Home screen 🏠 or Events screen. 🗓️

    This screen will show you a list of all upcoming events, probably starting with what's happening today. ☀️

    You can scroll with your finger (swipe up and down) to see the full list. 👇👆

    If you see an event you want to know more about, just tap on it. 👉

    A new screen will open showing you all the details: ℹ️

        What the event is 📝

        When it starts and ends ⏰

        Where it is (the location or recreation center) 📍

        A description of the event 🗒️

How to Search for Specific Events 🔍

If you're looking for something specific, the Search feature is your best friend. 🕵️‍♀️

    Look for a magnifying glass icon (🔍) or a bar that says "Search". It's usually at the top of the screen. 🔝

    Tap on the search bar. Your on-screen keyboard will pop up. ⌨️

    Type what you're looking for. ✍️

        Example: Golf ⛳

        Example: Mahjong 🀄

        Example: Saturday 🗓️

    The app will automatically filter the list to show you only the events that match your search. ✅

How to Save a "Favorite" Event ❤️

When you find an event you don't want to forget, save it as a "Favorite." ⭐

    When you are looking at the details for an event, look for a Heart icon (❤️) or a Star icon (⭐).

    Tap the icon! It will usually fill in with color, showing you've saved it. 💖

    That's it! The event is now saved. ✅

    To find your list of saved events, look for a "Favorites" or "My Events" section in the app menu. 📋

How to Get Notifications (Alerts) 🔔

A notification is a small pop-up message from the app that appears on your phone's screen. 📱

    For Reminders: When you save an event as a "Favorite" (see above), the app may ask if you want a reminder. You can set it to alert you 1 hour before the event, for example. ⏰

    For Community News: The app might also send alerts for important, all-community news, like a road closure 🚧 or a special holiday schedule. 🥳

    Tool Tip: The first time you use the app, your phone will ask, "Allow 'Village_Connect' to send you notifications?" It is highly recommended that you tap "Allow" to get these helpful reminders. ✅ You can always change this later in your phone's Settings. ⚙️
